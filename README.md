### Hi there üëã, I'm Yoshi Malaise
Integration Engineer @ Digipolis Antwerpen
PhD Candidate @ Vrije Universiteit Brussel

As a Full-Stack Software Engineer with a passion for writing software that positively impacts users, I bring more than 3 years of experience in developing robust, user-centric applications. My expertise spans both front-end and back-end technologies, allowing me to create seamless and efficient applications tailored towards the needs of my users. Throughout my career, I have successfully built and evaluated Proof-of-Concepts to investigate experimental new approaches as well as contributed to large applications that are actively used by thousands of users. My work in R\&D has equipped me with the ability to innovate and adapt quickly, turning ideas into practical, high-impact solutions. My commitment to innovation and excellence drives my ongoing pursuit of creating software that makes a meaningful difference. 

Aside from software engineering I am also passionate about accessible and open education. This is why I have been working on open source tools and resources in the domain of Computing Education Research, feel free to check them out and star them if you like them!
